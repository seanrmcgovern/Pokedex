# Pokedex
This is a Pokedex mobile application that can display data on 7 generations of Pokemon. The app also allows users to create parties, or designated groups of Pokemon, and add Pokemon to a list of favorites. Both parties and favorites are stored in Firebase, and displayed on the user profile. It was built with React-Native, Firebase for user authentication and database purposes, and Expo for deployment/development. Additionally, I used PokeAPI for data, with React-Native-Elements and NativeBase for basic components.
