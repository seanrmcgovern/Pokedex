# Pokedex
This is a Pokedex mobile application that can display data on all 8 generations of Pokemon. The app also provides a team builder, in which users can create designated parties (groups) of Pokemon, and add Pokemon to a list of favorites. It was built with React-Native and <a href="https://expo.io/">Expo<a> for deployment/development. Originally <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> was used for user authentication and database purposes. Now the app uses AsyncStorage. The branch "native-bridge-dev" contains the code from the ejected application, in which I used the <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-ios">Native Bridge<a> to store and retrieve data into <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata">Core Data<a>. Meanwhile the 'firebase" branch essentially represents version 1. Lastly, all data was fetched from the amazing <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeAPI<a>.
