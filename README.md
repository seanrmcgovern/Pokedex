# Pokedex
This is a Pokedex mobile application that can display data on 7 generations of Pokemon. The app also allows users to create parties, or designated groups of Pokemon, and add Pokemon to a list of favorites. Both parties and favorites are stored in Firebase, and displayed on the user profile. It was built with React-Native, <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> for user authentication and database purposes, and Expo for deployment/development. Additionally, I used <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeAPI<a> for data, with <a href="https://react-native-elements.github.io/react-native-elements/">React-Native-Elements</a> and <a href="https://nativebase.io/">NativeBase</a> for basic components. The app works on both Android and iOS, but is designed primarily for iOS.
